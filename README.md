# Virtual Scanners for Windows and Linux
This project provides virtual scanner implementations for both Windows and Linux operating systems. These virtual scanners allow applications to interact with simulated scanning devices, enabling testing and development without physical hardware.

## Overview

Virtual scanners simulate the behavior of physical scanner devices by:

- Appearing as real devices to the operating system
- Responding to scanning requests from applications
- Delivering pre-defined images as "scanned" content
