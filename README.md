# Virtual Scanners for Windows, Linux and macOS
This project provides virtual scanner implementations for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS** operating systems. These virtual scanners allow applications to interact with simulated scanning devices, enabling testing and development without physical hardware.

## Overview

Virtual scanners simulate the behavior of physical scanner devices by:

- Appearing as real devices to the operating system
- Responding to scanning requests from applications
- Delivering pre-defined images as "scanned" content
